My talk about Kiro - the IDE for AI powered spec-driven design

* Kiro landing page: https://kiro.dev

My lessons learned / hints:
* Carefully review requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md. Kiro tends to a quite detailed implementation, so it might make sense to remove items.
* Adjustments to the project can be made underway (e.g. removing a taks), Kiro will perform the needed corrections.


### FAQ:
* Can Kiro be also used for projects outside of AWS? **Yes**, Kiro is provider agnostic. Make sure to configure the necessary MCP servers to get started with other providers / stacks.
