            <title>AWS Outposts racks support multiple LGW routing domains</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;AWS Outposts racks now support multiple local gateway (LGW)
                routing domains, enabling you to create up to 10 isolated routing domains per
                Outpost, each with independent route tables and BGP sessions to your on-premises
                network. This feature provides traffic separation between routing domains and
                enables both customer-owned IP (CoIP) and direct VPC routing (DVR) modes on the same
                Outpost.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; With multiple LGW routing domains, you can segment
                on-premises network connectivity for different departments or business units sharing
                an Outpost. Each routing domain maintains its own LGW VIF Group, LGW Route Table,
                and VPC associations, preventing traffic from crossing between domains. You can
                configure multiple LGW routing domains through the AWS Management Console or AWS
                CLI.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Multiple LGW routing domains is available on
                second-generation Outposts racks at no additional charge. See the &lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/rack/faqs/"&gt;FAQs for Outposts
                racks&lt;/a&gt; for the latest list of supported AWS Regions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

            <title>Second-generation AWS Outposts racks are now supported in additional AWS Regions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Second-generation AWS Outposts racks are now supported in the
                South America (Sao Paulo) and Europe (Stockholm) Regions. Outposts racks extend AWS
                infrastructure, AWS services, APIs, and tools to virtually any on-premises data
                center or colocation space for a truly consistent hybrid experience.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; Organizations from startups to enterprises and the public sector in and
                outside of Europe and South America can now order their Outposts racks connected to
                these new supported regions, optimizing for their latency and data residency needs.
                Outposts allows customers to run workloads that need low latency access to
                on-premises systems locally while connecting back to their home Region for
                application management. Customers can also use Outposts and AWS services to manage
                and process data that needs to remain on-premises to meet data residency
                requirements. This regional expansion provides additional flexibility in the AWS
                Regions that customers’ Outposts can connect to.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To learn more
                about second-generation Outposts racks, read &lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-second-generation-aws-outposts-racks-with-breakthrough-performance-and-scalability-on-premises/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;this

            <title>Amazon S3 Storage Lens is now available in AWS GovCloud (US) Regions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon S3 Storage Lens provides organization-wide visibility into
                your storage usage and activity. S3 Storage Lens is now available in AWS GovCloud
                (US) Regions, bringing metrics to help you optimize storage costs, identify data
                protection opportunities, and improve application performance.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                S3 Storage Lens provides a single view of object storage usage and activity across
                thousands of accounts in an organization, with drill-downs to generate insights at
                multiple aggregation levels. You can optimize storage costs by identifying prefixes
                with incomplete multipart uploads or buckets accumulating non-current object
                versions. You can identify buckets that don’t follow your data protection best
                practices, such as using S3 Cross-Region Replication to replicate data across AWS
                Regions or S3 Versioning to keep multiple versions of an object. With the newly
                added performance metrics, you can identify application performance constraints—for
                example, using request and object size distribution metrics to detect inefficient
                access patterns or tracking cross-Region data transfer to reduce latency and
                costs.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Amazon S3 Storage Lens is available in all AWS Regions.
                S3 Storage Lens is pre-configured to receive free metrics by default for all
                customers and 14 days of historical data. For more detailed visibility with up to 15
                months data retention, you can upgrade to S3 Storage Lens advanced metrics. To learn
                more about S3 Storage Lens metrics, including free and advanced metrics, refer to
                the &lt;a
                href="https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/storage_lens_view_metrics.html"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.

            <title>AWS Clean Rooms now supports parameters in PySpark analysis templates</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;AWS Clean Rooms announces support for parameters in PySpark
                analysis templates, offering increased flexibility for organizations and their
                partners to scale their privacy-enhanced data collaboration use cases. With this
                launch, you can create a single &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/clean-rooms/latest/userguide/pyspark-analysis-templates.html"
                target="_blank"&gt;PySpark analysis template&lt;/a&gt; that allows different values
                to be provided by the Clean Rooms collaborator running a job at submission time
                without modifying the template code. With parameters in PySpark analysis templates,
                the code author creates a PySpark template with parameters support, and if approved
                to run, the job runner submits parameter values directly to the PySpark job. For
                example, a measurement company running attribution analysis for advertising
                campaigns can input time windows and geographic regions dynamically to surface
                insights that drive campaign optimizations and media planning accelerating
                time-to-insights.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; With AWS Clean Rooms, customers can create a secure data clean
                room in minutes and collaborate with any company on AWS or Snowflake to generate
                unique insights about advertising campaigns, investment decisions, and research and
                development. For more information about the AWS Regions where AWS Clean Rooms is
                available, see the &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/clean-rooms.html#clean-rooms_region"

            <title>AWS Databases are now available on v0 by Vercel</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL, Amazon Aurora DSQL, and Amazon DynamoDB
                serverless databases are now available on v0 by Vercel, an AI-powered tool that
                transforms your ideas into production-ready, full-stack web applications in minutes.
                With this launch, you can build your ideas as well as create and connect to AWS
                databases from v0 using natural language prompts.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To get
                started, simply describe what you want to build in v0. The tool takes care of
                developing the frontend user interface and backend logic, storing your application
                data in the AWS database that best meets your application needs. v0 provides an
                end-to-end setup experience where you can choose and configure database resources
                under a new AWS account or link to an existing account, all without leaving v0
                interface. New AWS accounts from Vercel include access to all three databases and
                $100 USD in credits that can be used with any of the database options for up to six
                months. You can also manage your plan, add payment information, and view usage
                details anytime by visiting the AWS settings portal from the Vercel dashboard. To
                learn more, visit &lt;a href="http://v0.app" target="_blank"&gt;v0&lt;/a&gt; or the

                page&lt;/a&gt; on the Vercel Marketplace.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The serverless
                options for &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/"
                target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/dsql/" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Aurora
                DSQL&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/?nc2=type_a"
                target="_blank"&gt;Amazon DynamoDB&lt;/a&gt; do not require infrastructure
                management and reduce costs by scaling down to zero automatically when not in use.
                You can create a database in the following &lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/"
                target="_blank"&gt;AWS Regions&lt;/a&gt;: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US
                West (Oregon), Europe (Ireland), Europe (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), and Asia
                Pacific (Mumbai).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; AWS Databases deliver security, reliability,
                and price performance without the operational overhead, whether you're prototyping
                your next big idea or running production AI and data driven applications. For more

            <title>Announcing Amazon EC2 Memory optimized X8i instances</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS) is announcing the general availability
                of Amazon EC2 X8i instances, next-generation memory optimized instances powered by
                custom Intel Xeon 6 processors available only on AWS. X8i instances are
                SAP-certified and deliver the highest performance and fastest memory bandwidth among
                comparable Intel processors in the cloud. They deliver up to 43% higher performance,
                1.5x more memory capacity (up to 6TB), and 3.4x more memory bandwidth compared to
                previous generation X2i instances.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; X8i instances are designed
                for memory-intensive workloads like SAP HANA, large databases, data analytics, and
                Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Compared to X2i instances, X8i instances offer
                up to 50% higher SAPS performance, up to 47% faster PostgreSQL performance, 88%
                faster Memcached performance, and 46% faster AI inference performance. X8i instances
                come in 14 sizes, from large to 96xlarge, including two bare metal
                options.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; X8i instances are available in the following &lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/"&gt;AWS
                Regions&lt;/a&gt;: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), and
                Europe (Frankfurt).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To get started, visit the &lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/"&gt;AWS Management Console&lt;/a&gt;. X8i
                instances can be purchased via Savings Plans, On-Demand instances, and Spot
                instances. For more information visit &lt;a

            <title>Amazon Connect now provides agent scheduling metrics in data lake</title>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;Amazon Connect now provides agent scheduling metrics in data lake,
                making it easier for you to generate reports and insights from this data. For
                example, after publishing schedules for next month, you can access interval level
                (15 minutes or 30 minutes) metrics such as forecasted headcount, scheduled
                headcount, and projected service level in Connect analytics data lake. You can view
                aggregated metrics for an entire business unit (forecast group) or broken down by
                specific demand segments (demand groups). You can then visualize this data in Amazon
                Quick Sight or another BI tool of your choice for further analysis, such as
                identifying periods of over or under-staffing. This eliminates the need for manual
                reviews of agent schedules thus improving productivity for schedulers and
                supervisors.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This feature is available in all &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/regions.html#optimization_region"&gt;AWS
                Regions&lt;/a&gt; where Amazon Connect agent scheduling is available. To learn more
                about Amazon Connect agent scheduling, click &lt;a

            <title>AWS Lambda announces cross-account access for DynamoDB Streams</title>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;AWS Lambda now supports cross-account access for AWS DynamoDB
                Streams event-source mappings (ESMs),&lt;br&gt; enabling you to trigger Lambda
                functions in one account from DynamoDB Streams in another account.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; Customers build event-driven applications using Lambda's fully-managed
                DynamoDB Streams ESMs, which poll change events from DynamoDB tables and trigger
                your Lambda functions. Organizations implementing multi-account
                architectures—whether to centralize event processing or share events with partner
                teams—previously needed to build complex data replication solutions to share data
                across accounts, which added operational overhead . With this launch, you can now
                provide cross-account access to your DynamoDB Streams to trigger Lambda functions in
                another account. By setting a &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/access-control-resource-based.html"&gt;resource-based
                policy&lt;/a&gt; on your DynomoDB stream, you can enable a Lambda function in one
                account to access DynomoDB stream in another account. This capability allows you to
                simplify your streaming applications across accounts without the overhead of
                replication solutions in each account.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This feature is
                generally available in all &lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/"&gt;AWS
                Commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions&lt;/a&gt;. You can enable cross-account
                Lambda triggers by creating resource-based policies for your DynamoDB Streams using
                the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, AWS CloudFormation, or AWS APIs. To
                learn more, read Lambda ESM &lt;a

            <title>Amazon Redshift Serverless adds queue-based query resource management</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Redshift Serverless introduces queue-based query resource
                management. You can create dedicated query queues with customized monitoring rules
                for different workloads. This feature provides granular control over resource usage.
                Queues let you set metrics-based predicates and automated responses. For example,
                you can configure rules to automatically abort queries that exceed time limits or
                consume too many resources.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Previously, Query Monitoring Rules
                (QMR) were applied only at the Redshift Serverless workgroup level, affecting all
                queries run in this workgroup uniformly. The new queue-based approach lets you
                create queues with distinct monitoring rules. You can assign these queues to
                specific user roles and query groups. Each queue operates independently, with rules
                affecting only the queries within that queue. The available monitoring metrics can
                be found in &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/cm-c-wlm-query-monitoring-rules.html#cm-c-wlm-query-monitoring-metrics-serverless"
                target="_blank"&gt;Query monitoring metrics for Amazon Redshift
                Serverless&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This feature is available in all &lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/"
                target="_blank"&gt;AWS regions&lt;/a&gt; that support Amazon Redshift Serverless.
                You can manage QMR with queues through the AWS Console and Redshift APIs.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; For implementation details, see the &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/serverless-workgroup-query-limits.html"

            <title>Amazon EBS now supports up to four Elastic Volumes modifications in 24 hours</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) now supports up to four Elastic
                Volumes modifications per volume within a rolling 24-hour window. Elastic Volumes
                modifications allow you to increase the size, change the type, and adjust the
                performance of your EBS volumes. With this update, you can start a new modification
                immediately after the previous one completes, as long as you have initiated fewer
                than four modifications in the past 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This enhancement improves your operational agility to immediately scale
                storage capacity or adjust performance in response to sudden data growth or
                unanticipated workload spikes. With Elastic Volumes modifications, you can modify
                your volumes without detaching them or restarting your instances, allowing your
                application to continue running with minimal performance impact.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This feature is available in all commercial AWS Regions, the AWS GovCloud
                (US) Regions, and the China Regions. This capability is automatically enabled
                without requiring changes to your existing workflows. To learn more,

            <title>AWS Data Exports adds granular operation visibility for Amazon Bedrock model
                usage</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;AWS Data Exports now enables customers to distinguish between
                Amazon Bedrock operation types in their cost reports for enhanced cost analysis and
                optimization. This granular operation information is available in Cost and Usage
                Reports (CUR), CUR 2.0, and Data Exports for FOCUS, and is particularly valuable for
                FinOps teams, cost optimization professionals, and organizations using Amazon
                Bedrock that require detailed billing analysis.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Customers will
                now see specific operation types such as "InvokeModelInference" and
                "InvokeModelStreamingInference" in their cost reports, replacing generic "Usage"
                labels. These granular operation types appear in the "line_item_operation" column in
                Legacy CUR and CUR 2.0 reports, the "x_Operation" column in FOCUS reports, and AWS
                Cost Explorer API Operation dimension values. This visibility now extends to all
                foundation models on Amazon Bedrock, enabling precise tracking of usage patterns and
                cost optimization opportunities across all model providers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To

            <title>Amazon VPC IPAM policies now support RDS and Application Load Balancers</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) IP Address Manager (IPAM) now
                supports policies for Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) instances and
                Application Load Balancers (ALB). This feature enables IP administrators to
                centrally configure and enforce IP allocation strategies for these resources,
                improving operational posture and simplifying network and security
                management.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Using IPAM policies, IP administrators can
                centrally define public IP allocation rules for AWS resources, such as RDS
                instances, Application Load Balancers and Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateways
                when used in regional availability mode, and Elastic IP addresses. The IP allocation
                policy configured centrally cannot be superseded by individual application teams,
                ensuring compliance at all times. Before this feature, IP administrators had to
                educate database administrators and application developers about IP allocation
                requirements for RDS instances and Application Load Balancers, and rely on them to
                always comply with best practices. Now, you can add IP-based filters for RDS and ALB
                traffic in your networking and security constructs like access control lists, route
                tables, security groups, and firewalls, with confidence that public IPv4 address
                assignments to these resources always come from specific IPAM pools.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; The feature is available in all AWS commercial regions and the AWS
                GovCloud (US) Regions, in both Free Tier and Advanced Tier of VPC IPAM. When used
                with the Advanced Tier of VPC IPAM, customers can set policies across AWS accounts
                and AWS regions. To get started please see the &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/define-public-ipv4-allocation-strategy-with-ipam-policies.html"

            <title>Amazon Bedrock introduces API keys to streamline development in GovCloud regions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;API keys for Amazon Bedrock are now available in AWS GovCloud (US)
                regions, expanding a feature that simplifies authentication and accelerates
                generative AI development. Originally launched in commercial AWS regions in July
                2025, API keys for Amazon Bedrock enable developers to quickly generate access
                credentials directly within the Amazon Bedrock console or AWS SDK without needing to
                manually configure IAM principals and policies.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; With the
                introduction of API keys for Amazon Bedrock, developers can generate short-term and
                long-term API keys directly from the Amazon Bedrock console or API to authenticate
                API calls to Amazon Bedrock models. Short-term API keys are valid for the duration
                of your console session, or up to 12 hours, whichever is shorter. Long-term API keys
                give you the flexibility to define key validity duration and manage the keys from
                the AWS IAM console.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Bedrock API key authentication is now
                available in the AWS GovCloud (US) and commercial &lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/?p=ngi&amp;amp;loc=4"&gt;AWS
                Regions&lt;/a&gt; where Amazon Bedrock is available.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To learn
                more about API keys in Amazon Bedrock, visit the&lt;a

            <title>AWS IoT Device Management launches Wi-Fi Simple Setup for managed integrations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;AWS IoT Device Management now offers Wi-Fi Simple Setup (WSS) for
                managed integrations, enabling developers to implement simplified Wi-Fi provisioning
                in Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. With WSS, developers can now integrate QR
                code scanning functionality that empowers end users to connect their Wi-Fi enabled
                devices using simple bar code scans, reducing device setup time and minimizing the
                need for technical support compared to manual configurations.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                The WSS capability operates through the managed integrations feature of AWS IoT
                Device Management. Managed integrations enables developers to control and manage
                devices across different vendors and connectivity protocols, while WSS helps
                streamline the device onboarding process. Once users securely store their Wi-Fi
                credentials in managed integrations, new device setup becomes nearly automatic.
                Users simply power on their new IoT device and scan its QR code using the solution
                provider's mobile app. The new device discovers and connects to a hidden network
                broadcasted by the IoT hub, which securely transmits the user's pre-stored Wi-Fi
                credentials to complete the onboarding process. This creates a near zero-touch
                experience for end users to securely and conveniently onboard Wi-Fi-connected
                devices into managed integrations-based IoT solutions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The
                managed integrations feature is available in Canada (Central) and Europe (Ireland)
                To learn more, refer to the &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-mi/latest/devguide/what-is-managedintegrations.html"&gt;developer
                guide&lt;/a&gt; and get started on the &lt;a
                href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home"&gt;AWS IoT
                console&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Enhanced Transactions view now available in AWS Billing Console</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;AWS announces significant improvements to the Transactions view in
                the AWS Billing and Cost Management Console’s Payments page, delivering faster
                performance, simplified payment reconciliation, and improved data accuracy. The
                enhanced view provides customers with a unified interface to manage all their
                financial transactions, improving visibility and reducing the time spent on payment
                tracking.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The enhanced view delivers improved performance, with

            <title>Amazon Neptune Database now supports R7g and R8g instances in 5 additional
                regions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/"&gt;Amazon Neptune
                Database&lt;/a&gt; now supports Graviton3-based R7g and Graviton4-based R8g
                instances for Amazon Neptune engine versions 1.4.5 or above, in Asia Pacific (Hong
                Kong), Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Canada (Central) and US West
                (N. California). R7g and R8g instances are priced -16% vs R6g.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                Graviton3-based R7g are the first AWS database instances to feature the latest DDR5
                memory, enabling high-speed access to data in memory. R7g database instances offer
                up to 30Gbps enhanced networking bandwidth and up to 20 Gbps of bandwidth to the
                Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS). Graviton4-based R8g instances offer larger
                instance sizes, up to 48xlarge and features an 8:1 ratio of memory to vCPU, and the
                latest DDR5 memory.&amp;nbsp;AWS Graviton4 processors are up to 40% faster for
                databases than AWS Graviton3 processors.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You can launch R7g and
                R8g instances for Neptune using the &lt;a
                href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/neptune/"&gt;AWS Management Console&lt;/a&gt;
                or using the &lt;a
                href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/neptune/index.html"&gt;AWS
                CLI&lt;/a&gt;. Upgrading a Neptune cluster to R7g or R8g instances requires a simple
                instance type modification for Neptune engine versions 1.4.5 or higher. For more
                information on pricing and regional availability, refer to the &lt;a

            <title>Amazon EC2 X8aedz instances are now available in Asia Pacific (Mumbai, Seoul)
                regions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting today, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) X8aedz
                instances are available in Asia Pacific (Mumbai) and Asia Pacific (Seoul) regions.
                These instances are powered by 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors (formerly code named
                Turin). These instances offer the highest maximum CPU frequency, 5GHz in the
                cloud.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; X8aedz instances are built using the latest sixth
                generation &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/"&gt;AWS Nitro
                Cards&lt;/a&gt; and are ideal for electronic design automation (EDA) workloads such
                as physical layout and physical verification jobs, and relational databases that
                benefit from high single-threaded processor performance and a large memory
                footprint. The combination of 5 GHz processors and local NVMe storage enables faster
                processing of memory-intensive backend EDA workloads such as floor planning, logic
                placement, clock tree synthesis (CTS), routing, and power/signal integrity
                analysis.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; X8aedz instances feature a 32:1 ratio of memory to
                vCPU and are available in 8 sizes ranging from 2 to 96 vCPUs with 64 to 3,072 GiB of
                memory, including two bare metal variants, and up to 8 TB of local NVMe SSD
                storage.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Customers can purchase X8aedz instances via Savings
                Plans, On-Demand instances, and Spot instances. To get started, sign in to the AWS
                Management Console. For more information visit the Amazon EC2 &lt;a

            <title>Amazon MSK Connect is now available in three additional AWS Regions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon MSK Connect is now available in three additional AWS
                Regions: Asia Pacific (New Zealand), AWS GovCloud (US-East), and AWS GovCloud
                (US-West).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; MSK Connect enables you to run fully managed Kafka
                Connect clusters with Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK). With a
                few clicks, MSK Connect allows you to easily deploy, monitor, and scale connectors
                that move data in and out of Apache Kafka and Amazon MSK clusters from external
                systems such as databases, file systems, and search indices. MSK Connect eliminates
                the need to provision and maintain cluster infrastructure. Connectors scale
                automatically in response to increases in usage and you pay only for the resources
                you use. With full compatibility with Kafka Connect, it is easy to migrate workloads
                without code changes. MSK Connect will support both Amazon MSK-managed and
                self-managed Apache Kafka clusters.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You can get started with
                MSK Connect from the Amazon MSK console or the Amazon CLI. With this launch, MSK
                Connect is now available in thirty eight AWS Regions. To get started visit, the MSK

            <title>Amazon Lex launches improved speech recognition models for English</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Lex now offers a neural automatic speech recognition (ASR)
                model for English that delivers improved recognition accuracy for your voice bots.
                Trained on data from multiple English locales, the model excels at recognizing
                conversational speech patterns across diverse speaking styles, including non-native
                English speakers and regional accents. This reduces the need for end-customers to
                repeat themselves and improves self-service success rates. To enable this feature,
                select "Neural" as the speech recognition option in your bot's locale
                settings.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This feature is available in all AWS commercial
                regions where Amazon Connect and Lex operate. To learn more, visit the &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/customizing-speech-model-preferences.html"
                target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Lex documentation&lt;/a&gt; or explore the Amazon Connect

            <title>Amazon SageMaker HyperPod now validates service quotas before creating clusters
                on console</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon SageMaker HyperPod console now validates service
                quotas&amp;nbsp;for your AWS account before initiating cluster creation, enabling
                you to confirm sufficient quota availability before provisioning begins. SageMaker
                HyperPod helps you provision resilient clusters for running AI/ML workloads and
                developing state-of-the-art models such as large language models (LLMs), diffusion
                models, and foundation models (FMs).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When creating large-scale
                AI/ML clusters, you need to ensure your account has sufficient quotas for instances,
                storage, and networking resources, but quota validation previously required manual
                checks across multiple AWS services, often resulting in failed cluster creation
                attempts and wasted time if you miss requesting quota limit increases. The new quota
                validation capability in the SageMaker HyperPod console automatically checks your
                account-level quotas against your cluster configuration, including instance type
                limits, EBS volume sizes, and VPC-related quotas when creating new resources. The
                validation displays a clear table showing expected utilization, applied quota
                values, and compliance status for each quota. When quotas may be exceeded, you
                receive a warning alert with direct links to the Service Quotas console to request
                increases.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This feature is available in all AWS Regions where
                Amazon SageMaker HyperPod is supported. For a complete list of service quota
                validation checks performed, refer to the &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-hyperpod-prerequisites.html#sagemaker-hyperpod-prerequisites-quotas"&gt;Amazon

            <title>Amazon Lex launches configurable voice activity detection sensitivity</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Lex now provides three VAD sensitivity levels that can be
                configured for each bot locale: Default, High, and Maximum. The Default setting is
                suitable for most environments with typical background noise levels. High is
                designed for environments with consistent but moderate noise levels, such as busy
                offices or retail spaces. Maximum provides the highest tolerance for very noisy
                environments such as manufacturing floors, construction sites, or outdoor locations
                with significant ambient noise. You can configure VAD sensitivity when creating or
                updating a bot locale in the Amazon Connect's Conversational AI designer.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This feature is available in all AWS commercial regions where Amazon
                Connect and Lex operate. To learn more, visit the &lt;a target="_blank"

            <title>Amazon Connect now provides agent screen recording status tracking</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Connect now offers customers the ability to view status of
                agent screen recordings in near real time in CloudWatch using Amazon EventBridge.
                With screen recording, supervisors can identify areas for agent coaching (e.g.,
                non-compliance with business processes) by not only listening to customer calls or
                reviewing chat transcripts, but also watching agents’ actions while handling a
                contact (i.e., a voice call, chat and task). Using Amazon EventBridge, customers can
                see status of each agent screen recording including success/failure, failure codes
                with description, installed client version, agent web browser version, agent
                operating system, screen recording start and end times from CloudWatch.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; Customers can start using Amazon Connect screen recording status tracking
                by subscribing to &lt;i&gt;Screen Recording Status Changed &lt;/i&gt;event type in
                Amazon EventBridge event bus.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Screen recording status tracking
                is available in all the &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/connect_region.html"

                compute used for the duration of the workloads on a per-second basis. You can
                benefit from this simplicity without making any changes to your existing analytics
                and business intelligence applications.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; With a few clicks in
                the AWS Management Console, you can get started with querying data using the Query
                Editor V2 or your tool of choice with Amazon Redshift Serverless. There is no need
                to choose node types, node count, workload management, scaling, and other manual
                configurations. You can create databases, schemas, and tables, and load your own
                data from Amazon S3, access data using Amazon Redshift data shares, or restore an
                existing Amazon Redshift provisioned cluster snapshot. With Amazon Redshift
                Serverless, you can directly query data in open formats, such as Apache Parquet,
                Apache Iceberg in Amazon S3 data lakes. Amazon Redshift Serverless provides unified
                billing for queries on any of these data sources, helping you efficiently monitor
                and manage costs.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To get started, see the Amazon Redshift

            <title>Amazon Inspector adds Java Gradle support and expands ecosystem coverage</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Inspector scanning for Lambda functions and Elastic
                Container Registry (ECR) images now supports Java Gradle inventory and vulnerability
                scanning. This release also adds coverage for MySQL, MariaDB, PHP, Jenkins-core,
                7zip (on Windows), Elasticsearch, and Curl/LibCurl. This update enhances Amazon
                Inspector's ability to detect vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across a broader
                range of applications and environments. Amazon Inspector is an automated
                vulnerability management service that continually scans AWS workloads for software
                vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure, helping organizations improve their
                security posture and meet compliance requirements.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The new Java
                Gradle support allows Inspector to scan Java dependencies based on gradle.lockfile
                content, providing comprehensive vulnerability assessments for Java applications.
                When you use Inspector to scan Lambda functions and ECR images, you will now see
                findings for MySQL, MariaDB, PHP, Jenkins-core, 7zip (on Windows), Elasticsearch,
                and Curl/LibCurl installations. These enhancements enable more accurate detection of
                vulnerabilities in packages installed outside of package managers, improving overall
                security coverage for AWS customers using these technologies.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                To learn more about Amazon Inspector and how it can help secure your AWS workloads,
                visit the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/"&gt;Amazon Inspector

            <title>Amazon EMR Serverless adds support for job run level cost allocation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/emr/serverless/"&gt;Amazon EMR
                Serverless &lt;/a&gt;now supports job run-level cost allocation that provides better
                visibility into charges for individual job runs by allowing you to configure
                granular billing attribution at the individual job run level. You can get granular
                cost visibility by filtering and tracking costs in AWS Cost Explorer and Cost and
                Usage Reports by specific job run IDs and cost allocation tags associated with job
                runs.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Amazon EMR Serverless is a deployment option in Amazon
                EMR that makes it simple for data engineers and data scientists to run open-source
                big data analytics frameworks without configuring, managing, and scaling clusters or
                servers. Previously, you could assign cost allocation tags to EMR Serverless
                applications, with cost attribution limited to the application level. With job
                run-level cost allocation, now you can assign cost allocation tags to each job run,
                enabling fine-grained billing attribution at the individual job run level. Cost
                allocation tags at the job run level also allow you to track costs by domains within
                a single application. For example, a single application could support jobs for
                finance and marketing domains, allowing you to track costs separately for each
                domain. Tracking costs for individual job runs makes it easier to conduct benchmarks
                that assess the costs of each job run as well as focus cost optimization efforts
                more precisely, allowing deeper insights into resource utilization and spending
                patterns across different jobs and domains.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This feature is
                available in all AWS Regions where Amazon EMR Serverless is available
                including&amp;nbsp;AWS GovCloud (US) and China regions. To learn more, see &lt;a

            <title>Amazon RDS for SQL Server now supports cross-region read replica in additional
                AWS Regions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/"
                target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for SQL
                Server&lt;/a&gt; now supports setting up cross-region read replicas in 16 additional
                AWS Regions. Cross-region read replicas enable customers to provide a replica
                database for read-only applications closer to users in a different region, and scale
                out read-only workloads. Since a read replica can be "promoted" to a standalone
                production database, cross-region read replicas can also be used for disaster
                recovery in case of regional failures. Customers can setup up to fifteen read
                replicas in the same or different region as the primary database instance.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; This launch adds support for cross-region read replicas in RDS for SQL
                Server in the following AWS Regions: Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong),
                Asia Pacific (Hyderabad), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), Asia Pacific (Malaysia), Asia
                Pacific (Melbourne), Asia Pacific (Taipei), Asia Pacific (Thailand), Canada West
                (Calgary), Europe (Milan), Europe (Spain), Europe (Zurich), Israel (Tel Aviv),

            <title>Amazon EC2 R8i and R8i-flex instances are now available in additional AWS regions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting today, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) R8i and
                R8i-flex instances are available in the Asia Pacific (Mumbai, Hyderabad) and Europe
                (Paris) regions. These instances are powered by custom Intel Xeon 6 processors,
                available only on AWS, delivering the highest performance and fastest memory
                bandwidth among comparable Intel processors in the cloud. The R8i and R8i-flex
                instances offer up to 15% better price-performance, and 2.5x more memory bandwidth
                compared to previous generation Intel-based instances. They deliver 20% higher
                performance than R7i instances, with even higher gains for specific workloads. They
                are up to 30% faster for PostgreSQL databases, up to 60% faster for NGINX web
                applications, and up to 40% faster for AI deep learning recommendation models
                compared to R7i.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; R8i-flex, our first memory-optimized Flex
                instances, are the easiest way to get price performance benefits for a majority of
                memory-intensive workloads. They offer the most common sizes, from large to
                16xlarge, and are a great first choice for applications that don't fully utilize all
                compute resources.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; R8i instances are a great choice for all
                memory-intensive workloads, especially for workloads that need the largest instance
                sizes or continuous high CPU usage. R8i instances offer 13 sizes including 2 bare
                metal sizes and the new 96xlarge size for the largest applications. &lt;a

            <title>Amazon Quick adds third-party AI agents and expands built-in actions library</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Quick is expanding its third-party integrations by adding
                AI agents and growing its built-in actions library. Quick is Amazon's new AI-powered
                workspace and agentic teammate that helps organizations get answers from their
                business data and move quickly from insights to action. As organizations navigate
                newly adopted AI agents and work with existing enterprise tools for CRM, support,
                collaboration, and more, users face fragmented experiences. Users are forced to
                switch between different interfaces, repeat context, and manually stitch together
                outputs. Quick enables users to work with third-party agents and enterprise tools
                from a single interface, eliminating the wasted time and cognitive load of
                constantly switching between applications.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; With Quick, business
                users can now invoke specialized agents from Box, Canva, and PagerDuty to accomplish
                chat and automation tasks. For example, you can pull incident insights from
                PagerDuty, generate a presentation in Canva, and query documents stored in Box - all
                directly from Quick. Additionally, Quick has expanded its built-in actions to
                include integrations with GitHub, Notion, Canva, Box, Linear, Hugging Face,
                Monday.com, HubSpot, Intercom, and more. This enables Quick users to accomplish
                tasks like creating GitHub issues, summarizing meeting notes in Notion, managing
                their CRM, and more. Beyond our new built-in integrations, customers can continue to
                leverage custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) and OpenAPI connectors to connect Quick
                to thousands of additional applications.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; These features are now
                available in all &lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/"&gt;AWS

            <title>AWS simplifies Client VPN onboarding with Quickstart setup</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, AWS announces a simplified onboarding experience for AWS
                Client VPN, introducing a new Quickstart setup method that streamlines the process
                of creating and configuring Client VPN endpoints.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; AWS Client
                VPN allows you to securely connect remote users to AWS resources and on-premises
                networks. The new Quickstart setup, reduces the number of steps required to set up
                an Client VPN endpoint. You can now easily set up Client VPN endpoints with
                pre-defined default configurations, requiring only three key inputs: IPv4 CIDR,
                server certificate ARN, and subnet selection. For example, development teams in
                large organizations who use Client VPN for remote access to their VPC resources for
                quick testing can now create endpoints quickly with the new simplified setup
                process.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The Quickstart method is available alongside the
                existing Standard Setup option, giving you the flexibility to choose the approach
                that best fits your deployment needs. Additionally, when you create a VPC, the
                Client VPN Quickstart workflow is automatically suggested as a follow up step. Once
                endpoint creation is complete, you can immediately download the client configuration
                file to connect using your VPN client. You can later modify and enhance your
                endpoint configuration using the Client VPN standard console or API as your usage
                patterns evolve. This enhancement is available at no additional cost in all AWS
                Regions where AWS Client VPN is generally available.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To learn
                more about Client VPN:&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

            <title>AWS Marketplace Seller Reporting now provides collections visibility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, AWS announces collection visibility in AWS Marketplace
                Seller Reporting, which adds up-to-date payment collection status to the Billed
                Revenue Dashboard and Billing Event Data Feed.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This enhancement
                enables sellers to distinguish between invoiced, collected, and disbursed amounts,
                eliminating the visibility gap between invoice creation and disbursement. With this
                feature, sellers can make informed business decisions and reduce unnecessary
                follow-ups with customers about payment status.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Collection
                visibility particularly benefits sellers using monthly disbursement who previously
                waited up to 30 days to understand payment collection status. All AWS Marketplace
                sellers can now improve payment forecasting accuracy and detect collection issues
                earlier. This enhanced visibility streamlines seller operations and improves
                customer relationships by providing clarity on payment status.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                Collection visibility is available in all AWS Regions where AWS Seller Reporting is
                available. The feature launches on January 6th, 2026 for all AWS sellers.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; To access collection visibility, log into the &lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/homepage/"
                target="_blank"&gt;AWS Marketplace Management Portal&lt;/a&gt; and navigate to
                Insights → &lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/insights/finance"
                target="_blank"&gt;Finance Operations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Amazon ECS now supports tmpfs mounts on AWS Fargate and ECS Managed Instances</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon
                Elastic Container Service&lt;/a&gt; (Amazon ECS) now supports tmpfs mounts for Linux
                tasks running on AWS Fargate and Amazon ECS Managed Instances, extending beyond the
                EC2 launch type. With tmpfs, you can now create memory‑backed file systems for your
                containerized workloads without writing this data to task storage.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; tmpfs mounts provide a temporary file system that is backed by memory and
                exposed inside the container at a path you choose. This is ideal for
                performance‑sensitive workloads that need fast access to scratch files, caches, or
                temporary working sets, and for security‑sensitive data such as short‑lived secrets
                or credentials, because the data does not persist after the task stops. tmpfs also
                lets you keep the container root file system read‑only using the
                readonlyRootFilesystem setting while still allowing applications to write to
                specific in‑memory directories.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To get started, update your
                task definition so that the container definitions include a linuxParameters block
                with one or more tmpfs entries. For each tmpfs mount, specify the containerPath,
                size, and optional mountOptions. You can register or update task definitions using
                the Amazon ECS console, AWS CLI, AWS CloudFormation, or AWS CDK. This feature is
                available in all AWS Regions where Amazon ECS, AWS Fargate, and Amazon ECS Managed
                Instances are supported. To learn more, see the LinuxParameters and Tmpfs sections
                in the &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_Tmpfs.html"

            <title>Amazon MQ now supports HTTP based authentication for RabbitMQ brokers</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon MQ now supports the ability for RabbitMQ brokers to perform
                authentication (determining who can log in) and authorization (determining what
                permissions they have) by making requests to an HTTP server. This plugin can be
                configured on brokers running RabbitMQ 4.2 and above on Amazon MQ by making changes
                to the associated configuration file.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To start using HTTP based
                authentication and authorization on Amazon MQ, simply select RabbitMQ 4.2 when
                creating a new broker using the m7g instance type through the AWS Management
                console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs, and then edit the associated configuration file. To
                learn more about the plugin, see the &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/amazon-mq-release-notes.html"
                target="_blank"&gt;Amazon MQ release notes&lt;/a&gt; and the Amazon MQ &lt;a

                target="_blank"&gt;regions&lt;/a&gt; where Amazon MQ RabbitMQ 4 instances are
                available today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>AWS Config now supports 21 new resource types</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;AWS Config now supports 21 additional AWS resource types across
                key services including Amazon EC2, Amazon SageMaker, and Amazon S3 Tables. This
                expansion provides greater coverage over your AWS environment, enabling you to more
                effectively discover, assess, audit, and remediate an even broader range of
                resources.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; With this launch, if you have enabled recording for
                all resource types, then AWS Config will automatically track these new additions.
                The newly supported resource types are also available in Config rules and Config
                aggregators.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You can now use AWS Config to monitor the

            <title>EC2 Capacity Manager now includes Spot interruption metrics</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, AWS announces new Spot interruption metrics for Amazon EC2
                Capacity Manager that allow you to better understand Spot capacity across your
                organization. EC2 Capacity Manager helps you monitor, analyze, and manage your EC2
                capacity across On-Demand, Spot, and Capacity Reservations from a single location.
                With this new capability, you can now track how many Spot instances are running,
                monitor interruption counts, and calculate interruption rates across regions,
                availability zones, and accounts. This enables you to make data-driven decisions
                about your Spot instance strategy.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; EC2 Capacity Manager now
                includes three new metrics: ‘Spot Total Count’, ‘Spot Total Interruptions’, and
                ‘Spot Interruption Rate. ‘Spot Total Count’ shows the total number of distinct Spot
                instances or vCPUs that ran during a selected period, ‘Spot Total Interruptions’
                tracks how many were interrupted, and ‘Spot Interruption Rate’ calculates the
                percentage of running instances that experienced interruptions. This data helps you
                identify patterns, compare across different regions and availability zones, and
                optimize your Spot instance strategy by diversifying instance types, expanding
                across availability zones, or using &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-placement-score.html"
                target="_blank"&gt;Spot placement score&lt;/a&gt; to identify optimal capacity pools
                with higher availability.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; EC2 Capacity Manager with Spot
                interruption metrics is available in all &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-infrastructure/latest/regions/aws-regions.html"

            <title>AWS Clean Rooms now supports detailed monitoring for collaboration queries</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, AWS Clean Rooms announces the launch of detailed monitoring
                for SQL queries in a collaboration. This new capability publishes detailed metrics
                to CloudWatch for operational monitoring of collaborations, including query
                performance and resource utilization.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You can choose to publish
                detailed monitoring metrics for SQL queries run in a Clean Rooms collaboration to
                CloudWatch, helping you improve the observability for your workloads at scale. The
                collaboration creator can enable detailed monitoring for a collaboration, and the
                analysis runner or configured payor can enable detailed monitoring when configuring
                their collaboration membership. For example, advertisers can monitor their campaign
                lift analysis queries in CloudWatch to identify performance issues and optimize
                costs.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; With AWS Clean Rooms, customers can create a secure data
                clean room in minutes and collaborate with any company on AWS or Snowflake to
                generate unique insights about advertising campaigns, investment decisions, and
                research and development. For more information about the AWS Regions where AWS Clean
                Rooms is available, see the &lt;a

            <title>Amazon Connect now provides the capability to store nested JSON object and
                looping arrays</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Connect now enables you to store and work with complex data
                structures in your flows, making it easy to build dynamic automated experiences that
                use rich information returned from your internal business systems. You can save
                complete data records, including nested JSON objects and lists, and reference
                specific elements within them, such as a particular order from a list of orders
                returned in JSON format.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Additionally, you can automatically
                loop through lists of items in your customer service flows, moving through each
                entry in sequence while tracking the current position in the loop. This allows you
                to easily access item-level details and present relevant information to
                end-customers. For example, a travel agency can retrieve all of a customer’s
                itineraries in a single request and guide the caller through each booking to review
                or update their reservations. A bank can similarly walk customers through recent
                transactions one by one using data retrieved securely from its systems. These
                capabilities reduce the need for repeated calls to your business systems, simplify
                workflow design, and make it easier to deliver advanced automated experiences that
                adapt as your business requirements evolve.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To learn more about
                these features, see the &lt;a

            <title>AWS launches simplified import of CloudTrail Lake data in Amazon CloudWatch</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, AWS launches simplified import of CloudTrail Lake data in
                Amazon CloudWatch, a data management and analytics service that allows you to unify
                operational, security, and compliance data across your AWS environment and
                third-party sources. With this launch, you can now import your historical CloudTrail
                Lake data into CloudWatch with a few steps enabling you to easily consolidate
                operational, security, and compliance data in one place. In CloudWatch, you simply
                specify the CloudTrail Lake event data store (EDS), and the date range to initiate
                import of your CloudTrail data. Simplified import of CloudTrail Lake data is
                supported via the AWS console, CLI, and SDK.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; While simplified
                import of CloudTrail Lake data is available at no additional cost, you incur
                CloudWatch fees based on custom logs pricing. To learn more about simplified import
                of CloudTrail Lake data and supported AWS regions, visit the &lt;a

            <title>Amazon Connect dashboards now support filtering metrics based on custom business
                dimensions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Connect dashboards now support filtering metrics based on
                custom business dimensions such as business divisions, product lines, or customer
                segments. Using predefined attributes, you can create business dimensions to filter
                metrics helping you customize the dashboards based on your unique business need. For
                example, if your queue handles contacts across product lines, you can filter metrics
                by product line to compare handle times and determine where agents need product
                training.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Amazon Connect dashboards are available in all AWS

                advanced reinforcement learning techniques and multi-environment post-training at
                scale, this model is ideal for enterprises, startups, and individual developers
                building multi-agent workflows, developer productivity tools, processes automation,
                and for scientific and mathematical reasoning analysis, amongst others.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Nano on Amazon Bedrock is powered by Project Mantle, a
                new distributed inference engine for large-scale machine learning model serving on
                Amazon Bedrock. Project Mantle simplifies and expedites onboarding of new models
                onto Amazon Bedrock, provides highly performant and reliable serverless inference
                with sophisticated quality of service controls, unlocks higher default customer
                quotas with automated capacity management and unified pools, and provides
                out-of-the-box compatibility with OpenAI API specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Nano is available today on Amazon Bedrock in US East (N.
                Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific

            <title>Amazon MSK expands Standard Brokers and Express Brokers to Asia Pacific (New
                Zealand) Region</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (&lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/msk/" target="_blank" style="cursor:
                pointer;"&gt;Amazon MSK&lt;/a&gt;) is now available in Asia Pacific (New Zealand)
                region. Customers can create Amazon MSK Provisioned clusters in this region starting
                today.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Amazon MSK is a fully managed service for Apache Kafka
                and Kafka Connect that makes it easier for you to build and run applications that
                use Apache Kafka as a data store. Amazon MSK is fully compatible with Apache Kafka,
                which enables you to more quickly migrate your existing Apache Kafka workloads to
                Amazon MSK with confidence or build new ones from scratch. With Amazon MSK, you
                spend more time building innovative streaming applications and less time managing
                Kafka clusters.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Amazon MSK offers two types of Apache Kafka
                provisioned broker - Standard brokers and Express brokers. Standard brokers offer
                the most flexibility to configure your cluster’s performance. You can configure
                availability, durability, throughput, and latency. You also control the storage
                configurations on your cluster and are responsible for managing storage provisioning
                and utilization. Express brokers are a new broker type for Amazon MSK Provisioned
                designed to deliver up to 3x more throughput per broker, scale up to 20x faster, up
                to 5x more partitions per broker, and reduce recovery time by 90% as compared to
                Standard brokers. Express brokers come pre-configured with Kafka best practices by
                default, support all Kafka APIs, and provide the same low-latency performance that
                Amazon MSK customers expect, so they can continue using existing client applications
                without any changes.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You can now create an MSK provisioned
                cluster with Standard or Express brokers in Asia Pacific (New Zealand) Region
                through the Amazon MSK console or the Amazon CLI. To get started, see
                the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

            <description>&lt;p&gt;AWS Transform now supports automatic network conversion from
                hybrid data centers, eliminating manual network mapping for environments running
                both VMware and non-VMware workloads. The service now analyzes VLANs and IP ranges
                across all exported source networks and maps these to AWS constructs like Virtual
                Private Clouds (VPCs), subnets, and security groups.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; AWS
                Transform for VMware is an agentic AI-powered service that automates the discovery,
                planning, and migration of VMware workloads, accelerating infrastructure
                modernization with increased confidence. The service extends support to hybrid data
                centers by analyzing exported data from application mapping tools such as modelizeIT
                to automatically generate Infrastructure as Code and provision AWS networking
                resources.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This feature is available in all &lt;a

            <title>AWS End User Messaging SMS launches a Generative AI Registration Reviewer
                (Preview)</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting today, AWS End User Messaging customers can use AWS
                generative AI to review their phone number registrations, so you can submit to
                mobile carriers correctly the first time. With the registration reviewer (preview),
                AWS will provide you feedback on your registration form checking the message sample,
                opt-in description, use-case, help and stop messages, etc., helping you submit an
                accurate and complete registration.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; AWS End User Messaging
                provides developers with a scalable and cost-effective messaging infrastructure
                without compromising the safety, security, or results of their communications.
                Developers can integrate messaging to support uses cases such as one-time passcodes
                (OTP) at sign-ups, account updates, appointment reminders, delivery notifications,
                promotions and more.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Support for generative AI registration
                reviewer is available in all AWS Regions where End User Messaging is available, see

            <title>Amazon Redshift supports four new materialized view (MV) features on data shares</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/" style="cursor:
                pointer;"&gt;Amazon Redshift&lt;/a&gt; now allows you to run create MV and refresh
                MV commands from multiple Amazon Redshift data warehouses. This update also allows
                you to create an MV on shared MVs. Finally, this release now supports concurrency
                scaling of the create materialized view (MV) data definition language (DDL)
                command.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; With this update, you can now scale the create MV DDL
                command whenever your main Amazon Redshift data warehouse cluster or workgroup runs
                out of resources simply by enabling concurrency scaling in your Amazon Redshift
                account.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You can start using these new capabilities immediately
                in all AWS regions where Amazon Redshift is available to scale your workload and
                build resilient analytics applications with predictable Service Level Agreements. To
                get started, refer to the &lt;a

            <title>AWS Deadline Cloud now supports direct job submission from the Deadline Cloud
                Monitor</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;AWS Deadline Cloud now lets you submit rendering jobs directly
                from the Deadline Cloud Monitor desktop application. This new feature makes it
                easier to submit renders for applications that don’t have built-in Deadline Cloud
                plugins or submission scripts, expanding compatibility with content creation tools
                and streamlining your rendering workflows.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Previously, you
                needed the command line interface (CLI) to submit job bundles. With this update, you
                can submit job bundles directly from Deadline Cloud Monitor desktop interface,
                managing jobs from start to finish in one place. It is particularly useful for
                legacy applications, specialized rendering tools, or custom workflows that lack
                built-in Deadline Cloud integration.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To access direct job
                submission, download the latest Deadline Cloud Monitor desktop application (version
                1.1.7) in the&lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a

            <title>Oracle Database@AWS now supports sharing of AWS Marketplace entitlements across
                accounts</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/featured-seller/oracle/"
                target="_blank"&gt;Oracle Database@AWS&lt;/a&gt; announced ability to share AWS
                Marketplace entitlements across accounts within an AWS Organization. With this
                feature, customers can now accept an Oracle Database@AWS AWS Marketplace offer in
                one AWS account, and share that entitlement with additional accounts in their AWS
                Organization. This allows customers to consume Oracle Database@AWS services from
                multiple AWS accounts using a single AWS Marketplace entitlement purchased for their
                organization.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Many Oracle Database@AWS customers use separate
                AWS accounts for their development and production environments, and for different
                business units within their organization. Customers want a single buyer agreement to
                use Oracle Database@AWS within their organization, and use the purchased AWS
                Marketplace entitlement across multiple business units, and across their development
                and production environments. With &lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/features/managed-entitlements/"
                target="_blank"&gt;AWS Marketplace Managed Entitlements&lt;/a&gt;, customers can now
                share their Oracle Database@AWS entitlement with other accounts in their AWS
                Organization using &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/license-manager/"
                target="_blank"&gt;AWS License Manager&lt;/a&gt; console or APIs. These accounts can
                accept and activate their shared AWS Marketplace entitlement from AWS License
                Manager, and then start consuming Oracle Database@AWS services using the shared
                entitlement.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This feature is available in all AWS Regions where
                Oracle Database@AWS is offered. For information about managing entitlements on
                Oracle Database@AWS, see &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/odb/latest/UserGuide/entitlement-sharing.html"

            <title>Amazon Kinesis Video Streams now supports IPv6 for WebRTC</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Kinesis Video Streams (Amazon KVS) now supports Internet
                Protocol version 6 (IPv6) addressing for WebRTC. This release introduces dual-stack
                endpoint support, enabling developers to use both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to stream
                video from millions of devices. The dual-stack support is designed to ensure that
                existing IPv4 implementations continue to work reliably while gaining IPv6
                connectivity benefits. Moreover, the update simplifies transition to IPv6 addresses
                while eliminating the need for address translation equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This feature is available in all commercial &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams-webrtc-dg/latest/devguide/availability.html"
                target="_blank"&gt;AWS Regions&lt;/a&gt; where Amazon KVS is offered, except Asia
                Pacific (Singapore) and China (Beijing, operated by Sinnet). For implementation

            <title>Amazon ECS Service Connect enhances observability with Envoy access logs in AWS
                GovCloud (US) Regions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon
                Elastic Container Service&lt;/a&gt; (Amazon ECS) Service Connect now supports Envoy
                access logs, providing deeper observability into request-level traffic patterns and
                service interactions. This new capability captures detailed per-request telemetry
                for end-to-end tracing, debugging, and compliance monitoring.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                Amazon ECS Service Connect makes it simple to build secure, resilient
                service-to-service communication across clusters, VPCs, and AWS accounts. It
                integrates service discovery and service mesh capabilities by automatically
                injecting AWS-managed Envoy proxies as sidecars that handle traffic routing, load
                balancing, and inter-service connectivity. Envoy Access logs capture detailed
                traffic metadata enabling request-level visibility into service communication
                patterns. This enables you to perform network diagnostics, troubleshoot issues
                efficiently, and maintain audit trails for compliance requirements.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; You can now configure access logs within ECS Service Connect by updating
                the ServiceConnectConfiguration to enable access logging. Query strings are redacted
                by default to protect sensitive data. Envoy access logs will output to the standard
                output (STDOUT) stream alongside application logs and flow through the existing ECS
                log pipeline without requiring additional infrastructure. This configuration
                supports all existing application protocols (HTTP, HTTP2, GRPC and
                TCP).&amp;nbsp;This feature is available with both Fargate and EC2 launch modes in
                AWS GovCloud (US-West) and AWS GovCloud (US-East) regions via the AWS Management
                Console, API, SDK, CLI, and CloudFormation. To learn more, visit the &lt;a

            <title>Amazon GameLift Streams launches Gen6-based stream classes and enhanced
                autoscaling for better performance and pricing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, Amazon GameLift Streams launched two new capabilities to
                optimize performance and cost: Gen6 stream classes and enhanced autoscaling with
                warm buffer. The new Gen6 stream classes provide a wider range of price performance
                options, while autoscaling enables customers to dynamically manage capacity
                scaling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The seven new Gen6 stream classes available
                today are based on&amp;nbsp;EC2 G6 instances powered by NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPUs,
                which provide up to 2x higher performance over Gen4 stream classes.
                The&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;pro&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;ultra&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;stream
                class&amp;nbsp;deliver improved performance for graphics-intensive AAA games, while
                the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;medium&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;small&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;stream
                class offer cost-efficient options for casual games. The
                &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;gen6n_small&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;stream class is available
                at $0.16/hour in us-east-2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The enhanced autoscaling
                capabilities provide automatic capacity management that scales provisioned capacity
                dynamically with demand, helping customers optimize utilization and stream start
                time for new players. Developers can use the new capacity controls (minimum,
                maximum, and target-idle capacity) to precisely manage their scaling
                needs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; New Gen6 stream classes are available in five
                AWS Regions: US West (Oregon), US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), Europe
                (Frankfurt), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo). Improved autoscaling is available in all AWS
                Regions where Amazon GameLift Streams is offered. To learn more and get started,

            <title>Amazon GameLift Streams launches real-time performance stats and improved API
                error messaging </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, Amazon GameLift Streams launched new powerful observability
                capabilities with session performance stats that provide real-time data for
                individual stream sessions, offering insights into application performance
                issues.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Game developers requested deeper visibility into session performance and
                resource utilization. The new stats we're delivering today help developers
                understand how their applications perform on specific stream classes and GPUs,
                giving them the data to make optimal GPU selections, optimize performance, and
                troubleshoot individual user experiences. Developers can now access detailed data on
                CPU, memory, GPU, and VRAM usage for active sessions through the GameLift Streams
                Web SDK, or view them in the AWS console's built-in overlay on the "Test stream"
                page. These performance stats can also be exported to a file for post-session
                analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;GameLift Streams also launched improved session status reasons and error
                messaging. Game developers now have deeper insights and actionable information on
                the reasons for stream session termination, enabling them to root cause unexpected
                termination and improve their troubleshooting experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; The stream session performance stats and improved API error messaging are
                available in all AWS Regions where Amazon GameLift Streams is offered at no
                additional cost.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To get started with these new features, create
                new stream groups. To integrate session performance stats into your clients,

            <title>Research and Engineering Studio on AWS Version 2025.12 now available</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we announce Research and Engineering Studio (RES) on AWS
                version 2025.12, which introduces tag propagation for CloudFormation resources,
                enhanced Windows domain configuration options, default session scheduling, and
                security improvements.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Research and Engineering Studio on AWS
                is an open source solution that provides a web-based portal for administrators to
                create and manage secure cloud-based research and engineering environments. RES
                enables scientists and engineers to access powerful Windows and Linux virtual
                desktops with pre-installed applications and shared resources, without requiring
                cloud expertise.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Tags applied to the CloudFormation stack now
                propagate to all resources created during RES deployment, making it easier to track
                costs and manage resources across your organization. Administrators can disable
                automatic Windows domain joining for hosts, providing flexibility to implement
                custom domain-join logic when needed. You can now set a default schedule for all new
                desktop sessions, helping teams standardize session management practices. This
                version includes several security improvements to help RES deployments meet the NIST
                800-223 standard and fixes a bug where some sessions were logged out after 2 minutes
                when using a custom DNS domain.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This release is available in
                all &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/res/latest/ug/plan-your-deployment.html#plan-your-deployment-supported-aws-regions"&gt;AWS

            <title>AWS Storage Gateway now supports Nutanix AHV hypervisor</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/"
                target="_blank"&gt;AWS Storage Gateway&lt;/a&gt; service now supports the Nutanix
                AHV hypervisor as a deployment option for S3 File, Tape and Volume gateways. If you
                use Nutanix AHV hypervisor-based on-premises infrastructure, you can now deploy
                Storage Gateway in your environment to access virtually unlimited cloud
                storage.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Nutanix AHV (Acropolis Hypervisor) is a KVM-based virtualization platform
                that is integrated into the Nutanix hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) solution.
                With this launch, you have the option to deploy Storage Gateway on a Nutanix AHV
                hypervisor.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that provides on-premises
                applications access to virtually unlimited cloud storage using NFS, SMB, iSCSI, and
                iSCSI-VTL interfaces. You can use the service to backup and archive data to AWS,
                shift on-premises storage to cloud-backed file shares, and provide on-premises
                applications low-latency access to data in AWS. You can deploy Storage Gateway as a
                virtual appliance (VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Linux KVM, and now Nutanix) on
                premises or as an Amazon EC2 instance in AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This capability is available in &lt;a

            <title>AWS Wickr launches admin APIs for programmatic network management at scale</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;AWS Wickr now provides a suite of admin APIs that empower
                administrators to programmatically manage secure communication networks at scale.
                These APIs enable you to automate critical administrative workflows including user
                lifecycle management, network configuration, and security group administration. With
                user lifecycle management APIs, you can automatically create users and assign
                security groups when employees join, or deactivate accounts when they leave. Network
                configuration APIs allow you to quickly create or delete networks on demand as your
                organization scales or restructures, and push standardized retention and federation
                policies across departments. Security group administration APIs enable automatic
                user placement based on directory attributes such as job function or clearance
                level. By connecting Wickr administration directly into your identity management
                systems, policy management frameworks, and automation pipelines, you can now manage
                secure communications infrastructure across thousands of users alongside your other
                cloud service integrations.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; AWS Wickr is a security-first messaging and collaboration
                service designed to help keep your communications secure, private, and compliant.
                AWS Wickr protects messaging, voice and video calling, file sharing, screen sharing,
                and location sharing with end-to-end encryption. Customers have full administrative
                control over data and users, including single sign-on (SSO) integration.
                Administrators can enforce policies that set password complexity and retention
                rules, configure ephemeral messaging options, or remotely delete credentials. You
                can log conversations to a private data store so you can retain messages and files
                sent to and from the organization to meet compliance requirements.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; The AWS Wickr Admin APIs are available today in all AWS regions where AWS
                Wickr is currently supported, including AWS GovCloud (US-West). You can leverage
                these APIs through AWS SDKs, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or direct
                REST API calls. To learn more, see:&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Amazon Application Recovery Controller region switch now supports three new
                capabilities</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) Region switch allows
                you to orchestrate the specific steps to switch your multi-Region applications to
                operate out of another AWS Region and achieve a bounded recovery time in the event
                of a Regional impairment to your applications. Region switch saves hours of
                engineering effort and eliminates the operational overhead previously required to
                complete failover steps, create custom dashboards, and manually gather evidence of a
                successful recovery for applications across your organization and hosted in multiple
                AWS accounts. Today, we are announcing three new Region switch
                capabilities:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;AWS GovCloud (US) support&lt;/b&gt;: ARC
                Region switch is now generally available in AWS GovCloud (US-East and US-West)
                Regions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Plan execution reports&lt;/b&gt;: Region
                switch now automatically generates a comprehensive report from each plan execution
                and saves it to an Amazon S3 bucket of your choice. Each report includes a detailed
                timeline of events for the recovery operation, resources in scope for the Region
                switch, alarm states for optional application status alarms, and recovery time
                objective (RTO) calculations. This eliminates the manual effort previously required
                to compile evidence and documentation for compliance officers and
                auditors.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;DocumentDB global cluster execution
                blocks&lt;/b&gt;: Adding to the catalog of 9 execution blocks, Region switch now
                supports Amazon DocumentDB global cluster execution blocks for automated
                multi-Region database recovery. This feature allows you to orchestrate DocumentDB
                global cluster failover and switchover operations within your Region switch
                plans.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To get started, build a Region switch plan using the ARC
                console, API, or CLI. See the AWS Regional Services List for availability
                information. Visit our &lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/application-recovery-controller/"
                target="_blank"&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; or read the &lt;a

            <title>AWS Private CA OCSP now available in China and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/private-ca/"
                target="_blank"&gt;AWS Private Certificate Authority&lt;/a&gt; (AWS Private CA) now
                supports Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) in China and AWS GovCloud (US)
                Regions. AWS Private CA is a fully managed certificate authority service that makes
                it easy to create and manage private certificates for your organization without the
                operational overhead of running your own CA infrastructure. OCSP enables real-time
                certificate validation, allowing applications to check the revocation status of
                individual certificates on-demand rather than downloading Certificate Revocation
                List (CRL) files.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; With OCSP support, customers in these Regions
                can implement more efficient certificate validation with minimal bandwidth,
                typically requiring a few hundred bytes per query, versus downloading large
                Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) that can be hundreds of kilobytes or larger.
                This enables real-time revocation checks for use cases such as validating internal
                microservices communications, implementing zero trust security architectures, and
                authenticating IoT devices. AWS Private CA fully manages the OCSP responder
                infrastructure, providing high availability without requiring you to deploy or
                maintain OCSP servers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; OCSP is now also available in the
                following AWS Regions: China (Beijing), and China (Ningxia), AWS GovCloud (US-East),
                AWS GovCloud (US-West).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To enable OCSP for your certificate
                authorities, use the AWS Private CA console, AWS CLI, or API. To learn more about
                OCSP, see &lt;a

            <title>Amazon SageMaker Studio now supports SOCI indexing for faster container startup
                times</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, AWS announces SOCI (Seekable Open Container Initiative)
                indexing support for Amazon SageMaker Studio, reducing container startup times by
                30-50% when using custom images. Amazon SageMaker Studio is a fully integrated,
                browser-based environment for end-to-end machine learning development. SageMaker
                Studio provides pre-built container images for popular ML frameworks like
                TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn that enable quick environment setup. However,
                when data scientists need to tailor environments for specific use cases with
                additional libraries, dependencies, or configurations, they can build and register
                custom container images with pre-configured components to ensure consistency across
                projects. As ML workloads become increasingly complex, these custom container images
                have grown in size, leading to startup times of several minutes that create a
                bottlenecks in iterative ML development where quick experimentation and rapid
                prototyping are essential.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;a
                href="https://github.com/awslabs/soci-snapshotter"&gt;SOCI indexing&lt;/a&gt;
                addresses this challenge by enabling lazy loading of container images, downloading
                only the necessary components to start applications with additional files loaded
                on-demand as needed. Instead of waiting several minutes for complete custom image
                downloads, users can begin productive work in seconds while the environment
                completes initialization in the background. To use SOCI indexing, create a SOCI
                index for your custom container image using tools like Finch CLI, nerdctl, or Docker
                with SOCI CLI, push the indexed image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR),
                and reference the image index URI when creating SageMaker Image resources.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; SOCI indexing is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon SageMaker
                Studio is available. To learn more about implementing SOCI indexing for your
                SageMaker Studio custom images, see &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-unified-studio/latest/userguide/byoi.html"&gt;Bring
                your own SageMaker image&lt;/a&gt; in the Amazon SageMaker Developer
                Guide.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Amazon RDS enhances observability for snapshot exports to Amazon S3</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) now offers enhanced
                observability for your snapshot exports to Amazon S3, providing detailed insights
                into export progress, failures, and performance for each task. These notifications
                enable you to monitor your exports with greater granularity and enables more
                predictability.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; With snapshot export to S3, you can export data
                from your RDS database snapshots to Apache Parquet format in your Amazon S3 bucket.
                This launch introduces four new event types, including current export progress and
                table-level notifications for long-running tables, providing more granular
                visibility into your snapshot export performance and recommendations for
                troubleshooting export operation issues. Additionally, you can view export progress,
                such as the number of tables exported and pending, along with exported data sizes,
                enabling you to better plan your operations and workflows. You can subscribe to
                these events through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to receive
                notifications and view the export events through the AWS Management Console, AWS
                CLI, or SDK.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This feature is available for RDS PostgreSQL, RDS
                MySQL, and RDS MariaDB engines in all &lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/"
                target="_blank"&gt;Commercial Regions&lt;/a&gt; where RDS is generally
                available.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To learn more about the new event types, see &lt;a

            <title>Amazon Bedrock Data Automation launches instruction optimization for your
                document blueprints</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) now supports blueprint
                instruction optimization, enabling you to improve the accuracy of your custom field
                extraction using just a few example document assets with ground truth labels. BDA
                automates the generation of insights from unstructured multimodal content such as
                documents, images, audio, and videos for your GenAI-powered applications. Blueprint
                instruction optimization automatically refines the natural language instructions in
                your blueprints, helping you achieve production-ready accuracy in minutes without
                model training or fine-tuning.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; With blueprint instruction
                optimization, you can now bring up to 10 representative document assets from your
                production workload and provide the correct, expected values for each field.
                Blueprint instruction optimization analyzes the differences between your expected
                results and the Data Automation inference results, and then refines the natural
                language instructions to improve extraction accuracy across your examples. For your
                intelligent document processing applications, you can now improve the accuracy of
                extracting insights such as invoice line items, contract terms, tax form fields, or
                medical billing codes. After optimization completes, you receive detailed evaluation
                metrics including exact match rates and F1 scores measured against your ground
                truth, giving you confidence that your blueprint is ready for production deployment.
                &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Data Automation blueprint instruction optimization for
                documents is available in all &lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/"&gt;AWS
                Regions&lt;/a&gt; where Amazon Bedrock Data Automation is supported. &lt;br&gt;

            <title>Amazon ECR now supports creating repositories on push</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) now supports automatic
                repository creation on image push. This new capability simplifies container
                workflows by having ECR automatically create repositories if they don't exist when
                an image is pushed, without customers having to pre-create repositories before
                pushing container images. Now when customers push images, ECR will automatically
                create repositories according to defined repository creation template
                settings.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Create on push is available in all AWS commercial and
                AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. To learn more about repository creation templates, please

            <title>Announcing Cost Allocation Tags support for Account Tags</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;AWS announces Cost Allocation tags support for account tags across
                AWS Cost Management products, enabling customers with multiple member accounts to
                utilize their existing AWS Organizations account tags directly in cost management
                tools. Account tags are applied at the account level in AWS Organizations and
                automatically apply to all metered usage within tagged accounts, eliminating the
                need to manually configure and maintain separate account groupings in AWS Cost
                Explorer, Cost and Usage Reports, AWS Budgets, and Cost Categories.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; With account tag support, customers can analyze costs by account tag
                directly in Cost Explorer and Cost and Usage Reports (CUR 2.0 and FOCUS). Customers
                can set up AWS Budgets and AWS Cost Anomaly Detection alerts on groups of accounts
                without configuring lists of account IDs. Customers can also build complex cost
                categories on top of account tags for further categorization. Account tags enable
                cost allocation for untaggable resources including refunds, credits, and certain
                service charges that cannot be tagged at the resource level. When new accounts join
                the organization or existing accounts are removed, customers simply add or update
                relevant tags, and the changes automatically apply across all cost management
                products. To get started, customers apply tags to accounts in the AWS Organizations
                console, then activate those account tags from the Cost Allocation Tags page in the
                Billing and Cost Management console. This feature is generally available in all AWS
                Regions, excluding GovCloud (US) Regions and China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia)
                Regions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To learn more, see &lt;a

            <title>AWS IoT now offers event-based logging to help optimize observability costs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;AWS IoT now supports event-based logging, a new capability that
                helps developers reduce Amazon CloudWatch costs while improving log management
                efficiency. This feature enables targeted logging for individual event with
                customizable log levels and Amazon CloudWatch log group destinations.&lt;br&gt; With
                Event-Based Logging, you can set different log levels for different types of IoT
                events based on their operational importance. For example, you can configure
                INFO-level logging for certificateProvider events while maintaining ERROR-level
                logging for less critical activities like connectivity events. The granularity
                allows you to maintain comprehensive visibility into your IoT operations without the
                overhead of logging every activity at the same verbosity level, improving log
                searchability and analysis efficiency while helping to reducing costs.&lt;br&gt;
                Event-level logging is now available for configuration through the AWS IoT console,
                CLI, and API in all AWS Regions where AWS IoT is supported. To learn more about
                configuring Event-Based Logging, visit &lt;a

                on-premises or on AWS EC2 to Redshift with a simple experience that eliminates
                configuration complexity.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; AWS zero-ETL for self-managed
                database sources will automatically create an integration for an on-going
                replication of data from your on-premises or EC2 databases through a simple, no-code
                interface. You can now replicate data from Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL and PostgreSQL
                databases into Redshift. This feature further reduces users' operational burden and
                saves weeks of engineering effort needed to design, build, and test data pipelines
                to ingest data from self-managed databases to Redshift. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; AWS
                Glue zero-ETL for self-managed database sources are available in the following

            <title>Amazon EC2 now supports Availability Zone ID across its APIs</title>
            <description>
                &lt;p&gt;Amazon EC2 now supports Availability Zone ID (AZ ID) parameter,
                enabling you to create and manage resources such as instances, volumes, and subnets
                using consistent zone identifiers. AZ IDs are consistent and static identifiers that
                represent the same physical location across all AWS accounts, helping you optimize
                resource placement.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Prior to this launch, you had to use an AZ
                name while creating a resource, but these names could map to different physical
                locations. This mapping made it difficult to ensure resources were always co-located
                especially when operating with multiple accounts. Now, you can specify the AZ ID
                parameter directly in your EC2 APIs to guarantee consistent placement of resources.
                AZ IDs always refer to the same physical location across all accounts, which means
                you no longer need to manually map AZ names across your accounts or deal with the
                complexity of tracking and aligning zones. This capability is now available for
                resources including instances, launch templates, hosts, reserved instances, fleet,
                spot instances, volumes, capacity reservations, network insights, VPC endpoints and
                subnets, network interfaces, fast snapshot restore, and instance connect.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; This feature is available in all AWS regions including China and AWS
                GovCloud (US) Regions. To learn more about Availability Zone IDs, visit the &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/working-with-az-ids.html"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Amazon Aurora now supports PostgreSQL 17.7, 16.11, 15.15, 14.20 and 13.23</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition has added support for
                PostgreSQL versions 17.7, 16.11, 15.15, 14.20 and 13.23. The &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraPostgreSQLReleaseNotes/AuroraPostgreSQL.Updates.html"
                target="_blank"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; includes the PostgreSQL community's product
                improvements and bug fixes, and also includes Aurora-specific
                enhancements.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The release includes improvements to Blue Green
                deployments, resulting in reduced switchover times by limiting new commits on the
                primary instance. There are also enhancements to Query Plan Management (QPM), and
                improved instance recovery times by optimizing commit log loading during database
                recovery.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To use the new versions, create a new Aurora
                PostgreSQL-compatible database with just a few clicks in the Amazon RDS Management
                Console. You can also upgrade your existing database. Please review the Aurora &lt;a

                to upgrade and how to plan your upgrade process. These releases are available in all
                commercial AWS Regions and the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                Amazon Aurora is designed for unparalleled high performance and availability at
                global scale with full MySQL and PostgreSQL compatibility. It provides built-in
                security, continuous backups, serverless compute, up to 15 read replicas, automated
                multi-Region replication, and integrations with other AWS services. To get started

            <title>Amazon WorkSpaces Applications announces Elastic fleets powered by Ubuntu Pro
                24.04 LTS</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon WorkSpaces Applications now offers support for Ubuntu Pro
                24.04 LTS on&amp;nbsp;Elastic fleets, enabling Independent Software Vendors
                (ISVs)&amp;nbsp;and central IT organizations to stream Ubuntu desktop applications
                to users while leveraging the flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of
                the AWS Cloud.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Amazon WorkSpaces Applications is a fully
                managed, secure desktops and applications streaming service that provides users with
                instant access to their desktops and applications from anywhere. Within Amazon
                WorkSpaces Applications,&amp;nbsp;Elastic fleet is a server less fleet type that
                lets you stream desktop applications to your end users from an AWS-managed pool of
                streaming instances without needing to predict usage, create and manage scaling
                policies, or create an image. Elastic fleet type is designed for customers that want
                to stream applications to users without managing any capacity or creating WorkSpaces
                Applications images.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To get started sign into the WorkSpaces
                Applications management console and select one of the AWS Region of your choice. For

            <title>AWS IoT Core adds message batching to HTTP rule action</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/"
                target="_blank"&gt;AWS IoT Core&lt;/a&gt; now lets you batch multiple IoT messages
                into a single &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/https-rule-action.html"
                target="_blank"&gt;HTTP rule action&lt;/a&gt;, before routing the messages to
                downstream HTTP endpoints. This enhancement helps you to reduce cost and throughput
                overhead when ingesting telemetry from your Internet of Things (IoT)
                workloads.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; AWS IoT Core is a fully managed service that
                securely connects millions of IoT devices to the AWS cloud. Using &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-rules.html"
                target="_blank"&gt;rules for AWS IoT&lt;/a&gt;, you can filter, process, and decode
                device data, and route that data to AWS services or third-party endpoints via 20+
                &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-rule-actions.html"
                target="_blank"&gt;AWS IoT rule actions&lt;/a&gt;, such as HTTP rule action - which
                routes the data to HTTP endpoints. With the new feature, you can now batch messages
                together before routing that data set to downstream HTTP endpoints.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; To efficiently process IoT messages using the new batching capability,
                connect your IoT devices to AWS IoT Core and define a HTTP rule action with your
                desired batch parameters. AWS IoT Core will then process incoming messages according
                to these specifications and route the messages to your designated HTTP endpoints.
                For example, you can now combine IoT messages published from multiple smart home
                devices in a single batch and route it to a HTTP endpoint in your smart home
                platform.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This new feature is available in all AWS Regions
                where AWS IoT Core is available, including AWS GovCloud (US) and Amazon China
                Regions. To learn more, visit our &lt;a

            <title>Amazon WorkSpaces now supports IPv6</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon WorkSpaces now supports IPv6 for &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/workspaces-port-requirements.html#whitelisted_ports"&gt;WorkSpaces
                domains and external endpoints&lt;/a&gt;, enabling users to connect through an
                IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack configuration from compatible clients (excluding SAML
                authentication). This helps customers meet IPv6 compliance requirements and
                eliminates the need for costly networking equipment to handle address translation
                between IPv4 and IPv6.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Dual-stack support for WorkSpaces
                addresses the Internet's growing demand for IP addresses by offering a vastly larger
                address space than IPv4. This eliminates the need to manage overlapping address
                ranges within your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Customers can deploy WorkSpaces
                through dual-stack that supports both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols while maintaining
                backward compatibility with existing IPv4 systems. Customers can also connect to
                their WorkSpaces through PrivateLink VPC endpoints over IPv6, enabling them to
                access the service privately without routing traffic over the public
                internet.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Connecting to Amazon WorkSpaces over IPv4/IPv6
                dual-stack configuration is supported in all AWS Regions where Amazon WorkSpaces is
                available, including the AWS GovCloud (US East &amp;amp; US West) Regions. There is
                no additional cost for this feature.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; To enable IPv6, you must
                use &lt;a href="https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/"&gt;the latest WorkSpaces
                client application&lt;/a&gt; for Windows, macOS, Linux, PCoIP zero clients, or web
                access. To learn more about IPv6 support on Amazon WorkSpaces, refer to the &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/amazon-workspaces-vpc.html"&gt;Amazon
                WorkSpaces administration guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Amazon MSK Connect now supports dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) connectivity for new
                connectors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (&lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/msk/"&gt;Amazon MSK&lt;/a&gt;) now supports dual-stack
                connectivity (IPv4 and IPv6) for new connectors on Amazon MSK Connect. This
                capability enables customers to create connectors on MSK Connect using both IPv4 and
                IPv6 protocols, in addition to the existing IPv4-only option. It helps customers
                modernize applications for IPv6 environments while maintaining IPv4 compatibility,
                making it easier to meet compliance requirements and prepare for future network
                architectures.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Amazon MSK Connect is a fully managed service
                that allows you to deploy and operate Apache Kafka Connect connectors in a fully
                managed environment. Previously, connectors on MSK Connect only supported IPv4
                addressing for all connectivity options. With this new capability, customers can now
                enable dual-stack connectivity (IPv4 and IPv6) on new connectors using the Amazon
                MSK Console, AWS CLI, SDK, or CloudFormation by setting the Network Type parameter
                during connector creation. All connectors on MSK Connect will by default use
                IPv4-only connectivity unless explicitly opted-in for dual-stack while creating new
                connectors. Existing connectors will continue using IPv4 connectivity. To change
                that you will need to delete and recreate the connector.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                Dual-stack connectivity for new connectors on MSK Connect is now available in all
                &lt;a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/"&gt;AWS
                Regions&lt;/a&gt; where Amazon MSK Connect is available, at no additional cost. To
                learn more about Amazon MSK dual-stack support, refer to the &lt;a
                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/msk-connect.html"&gt;Amazon
